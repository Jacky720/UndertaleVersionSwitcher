The Linux 1.00, Linux 1.11, and Windows 1.11 runners are all repurposed from other games, as these versions of Undertale were not released on these platforms.

For reference, the following Undertale versions work with the following runners:
1.00 - 1.00 runner
1.001 - 1.001 runner
1.001-4, 1.001-v, and 1.01 through 1.08 - 108 runner
1.09 through 1.11 - 111 runner
