Hello! This is Space Core#0358's Undertale version switcher. You got one version of Undertale? With this, you got them all.

Converting versions has three steps:
1. If you have a version other than v1.08, on Windows, from Steam, convert it to that version using the appropriate version patch in the "Convert To 1.08" folder. You can check the version of your data/game.win/.ios/.unx file using the "Version Check" folder. Simply drag and drop your file onto "versioncheck.bat"
1a. To convert your file, open it and the appropriate .xdelta patch using "DeltaPatcherLite.exe". You can make a backup, if you like. Just copy the file somewhere else.

2. Now, you can convert your data file to any version you like. Find the appropriate .xdelta patch in "Convert To Anything Else", and open both your 1.08 data.win and the patch using DeltaPatcherLite.exe. You can make a backup, if you like. Just copy the file somewhere else.

3. Note that your new version might require a different version of the GameMaker runner file (UNDERTALE.exe). Four versions are included for Windows, which should cover all of the versions included in this zip. You're free to send me enough runners for other platforms. Also, any versions of the data file I don't have already.
3a. If a runner file fails to detect a data file, it will prompt you for a file. Select the data file. You can rename it to "data.win" for the Windows runners to detect it automatically, if it wasn't already.

That's it! Thanks to:
- mono21400 for all the console files. It's been pinned in the chat for too long for containing 95% of the game data.
- All the speedrunners for several more files (including 1.001 Linux and 1.05).
- The Underminers server for general support and, uh, there's probably a few more I found there and forgot about. Heh.
